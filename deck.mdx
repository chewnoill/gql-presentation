### what is GQL?

---

> Describe your data

<Code language="graphql">{`
type Project {
  name: String
  tagline: String
  contributors: [User]
}
`}</Code>

<Note>{`
graphql defines its own
"GraphQL Schema Language"
- a little confusing because
we reuse schema name for
something else later
`}</Note>

---

> Ask for what you want

<Code language="graphql">{`
{
  project(name: "GQL") {
    tagline
  }
}
`}</Code>

---

> Get predictable results

<Code language="json">{`
{
  "project": {
    "tagline": "A query language for APIs"
  }
}
`}</Code>

<Note>{`
formally: graphcool
controlling your database from your graphql server
Nice
 * simple
 * DSL for managing your database
 * sophisticated ORM
Not Nice
 * hard to manage migrations well
 * isn't built for connecting multiple databases
 * you don't want your frontend
    to be tightly coupled to your
    backend data
 * you want to combine multiple
    endpoints in your graphql
    layer

> Apollo Server

<Code language="js">{`
new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers
});
`}</Code>

<Note>{`
two required pieces
* typedefs: SDL schema definition
* resolvers: type implementations
`}</Note>

---

> typeDefs

<Code language="graphql">{`
new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs: gql\`
    type Query {
      collections: [Collection]
    }
    type Collection {
      id: ID!
      things: [Thing]
    }
    type Thing {
      id: ID!
      value: String!
    }\`,
  resolvers
});
`}</Code>

<Note>{`
simple gql schema
`}</Note>

---

> resolvers

<Code language="javascript">{`
new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers: {
    TypeName: {
      fieldName: (obj, args, context, info) => result
    }
  }
});
`}</Code>

<Note>{`
obj: The object that contains the
  result returned from the resolver
  on the parent field,
args: An object with the arguments
  passed into the field in the query.
context: This is an object shared
  by all resolvers in a particular
  query
info: no clue
`}</Note>

# Relay

> opinionated gql client

https://github.com/facebook/relay

<Note>{`
* relay style pagination
  * might as well
`}</Note>

---

<CodeSurf
    snippet="RelayModern.ts"
    lang="js"

<Note>{`
write fragments next to
components.
relay client will combine
all of the fragments you
want to use into one query
`}</Note>

# Schema First

#### because reasoning about your data is complicated

<Note>{`
CK experience
- disconnect frontend and backend
- communicate schema changes quickly
`}</Note>

---

### Modeling your Database

vs

### Modeling your UI

<Note>{`
- database
  seems to be the most popular
  consider using prisma
  postgraphile
- ui
  what CK is doing
  ab testing
  tracking
`}</Note>

## Making your schema a joke

#### Mocking your apollo server

<Note>{`
* unblocking the frontend
super easy, really no reason
not to do it. Even If you're
only building the FE, consider
doing it yourself.
`}</Note>

<img src="https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator/blob/master/logo.png?raw=true" />

#### because writing types sucks

<Note>{`
- type generation
- resolver signature generation
- react apollo hook generation
* codegen
  * you don't need to write the same types again
  * resolver signatures are built for you
  * react hook generators
  * can pass it a schema
  or intraspect a running
  gql server
`}</Note>

# Modularizing your schema

---

#### What is schema smushing?

<Horizontal>
    <Code language="javascript">{`
typedef: gql\`
  type User {
    id: ID!
    name: String
  }\`,
resolvers: {
  User: {
    id: getId,
    name: getName
  }
}
`}</Code>
    <Code language="javascript">{`
typedef: gql\`
  type User {
    email: String!
  }\`,
resolvers: {
  User: {
    email: getEmail
  }
}
`}</Code>
</Horizontal>

---

<Code language="javascript">{`
typedef: gql\`
  type User {
    id: ID!
    name: String
    email: String!
  }\`,
resolvers: {
  User: {
    id: getId,
    name: getName,
    email: getEmail
  }
}
`}</Code>

<Note>{`
* kind of the whole point of gql
you don't need to build your
graph all in one place.
build your graph one module at
a time, connect them all together
when you need to spin up a server.
* modularizing your schema
  * what is schema smushing?
  * the CK way
    * graphql loader
  * graphql modules
    * more smushing
`}</Note>

---

# GQL Loader

#### schema smushing at CK

https://github.com/creditkarma/graphql-loader

<Note>{`
 * only supports typedefs and resolvers
 * takes your typedefs,
   * finds duplicate types
   * merges fields
 * Creates executable schema from
   typedefs + resolvers
 * doesn't support smushing
 schemaDirectives
`}</Note>

---

# GQL Modules

https://github.com/Urigo/graphql-modules

<Note>{`
* better smushing
* supports more of the gql spec
  * schemaDirectives!!
* providers
  * extracting business logic out of your resolvers
  * extracting dataloading from modules
  * securing data access with scoped providers
* dependency injection
* better context management
`}</Note>

---

<CodeSurf
  snippet="GQLModulesSetup.ts"
  lang="typescript"
  step={{ range: [19,21] }}
/>

<Note>{`
* smush all your modules
together
* compose your graphql
server, like a graph
`}</Note>

---

<CodeSurf
  snippet="GQLModulesSetup.ts"
  lang="typescript"
  step={{ range: [30,42] }}
/>

<Note>{`
* create an executable schema
`}</Note>

---

## Authentication


<Note>{`
* use schema directives
and context to guard
entire subtrees
`}</Note>

---

<Code language="js">{`
new ApolloServer({
  typeDefs,
  resolvers,
  context: ({ req }) => ({
    user: authorize(req.headers.Authorization)
  }),
});
`}</Code>

<Note>{`
Some things need access to the request context
and the context is included for all resolvers
Now resolvers require things from
the context, breaking encapsulation
`}</Note>

---

<CodeSurf
    snippet="AuthModule.ts"
    lang="typescript"
    step={{ range: [23,25] }}
/>

---


<CodeSurf
    snippet="AuthModule.ts"
    lang="typescript"
    step={{ range: [29,37] }}
/>

<Note>{`
SchemaDirectives allow you to
wrap resolver functions from
your schema
`}</Note>

---

<CodeSurf
    snippet="AuthModule.ts"
    lang="typescript"
    step={{ range: [26,28] }}

<Note>{`
schemaDirectives

# Optimizing Data Access

https://github.com/graphql/dataloader

<Note>{`
write batch fetchs,
instead of fetching
one at a time
* optimising data access
  * data loader
    * https://github.com/graphql/dataloader
    * built in data caching,
    * request batching
`}</Note>

---

<Code language="typescript">{`
const resolvers = {
  Collection: {
    things: ({id}, _, {injector}) =>
      injector(CollectionThingLoader).load(id)
  }
}
`}</Code>

<Note>{`
resolver for the things
field inside the Collection
Type
-
simple api surface
to load data, by id
`}</Note>

---

<CodeSurf
    language="javascript"
    snippet="data-loader.ts"
    step={{ range: [1,17] }}
/>

<Note>{`
paginating this type of
query on a relational database
is hard.
* subqueries
* seperate queries
maybe you're better
off not doing it
`}</Note>

<Note>{`
still schema smooshing

individual services
`}</Note>

# Apollo Federation

<Note>{`
* Allows splitting types
